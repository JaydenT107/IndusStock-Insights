# IndusStock-Insights
IndusStock Insights is an AI-powered platform that identifies the top 5 stocks within a specific industry, pulls real-time data via a stock API to generate detailed charts, and provides intelligent, data-driven recommendations to help users decide whether to buy or hold. 

# Stock Analysis and Recommendation System using AI on AWS Lambda

## Overview

This project leverages AWS Lambda, AI, and stock market APIs to analyze and recommend stocks within specific industries. The system identifies the top 5 stocks in major industries, retrieves their historical data, generates performance charts, and provides AI-driven advice on whether to buy or avoid the stocks based on their performance over the past week. The stock data is then stored in an Amazon S3 bucket for future reference.

## Features

- **Top 5 Stock Identification**: Uses AI to identify the top 5 stocks in a specified industry.
- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Pulls historical stock data using a stock market API.
- **Performance Charts**: Generates visual charts to represent stock performance.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Provides buy/sell advice based on the stock's performance over the past week.
- **Data Storage**: Stores stock data in an Amazon S3 bucket for future analysis.

## Architecture

1. **AWS Lambda**: The core of the project, where the AI model and stock analysis logic are executed.
2. **Stock Market API**: Used to fetch historical stock data.
3. **AI Model**: Analyzes stock performance and generates recommendations.
4. **Amazon S3**: Stores the stock data and generated charts.
5. **Charts**: Visual representation of stock performance.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: To use AWS Lambda and S3.
- **Stock Market API Key**: To fetch stock data.
- **Python**: For writing the Lambda function.
- **AI Model**: Pre-trained model for stock analysis.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services.

## Setup

1. **AWS Lambda Setup**:
   - Create a new Lambda function.
   - Configure the necessary permissions to access S3 and other AWS services.

2. **Stock Market API**:
   - Obtain an API key from a stock market data provider.
   - Configure the API endpoint and key in the Lambda function.

3. **AI Model**:
   - Deploy the pre-trained AI model within the Lambda function.
   - Ensure the model is capable of analyzing stock performance and generating recommendations.

4. **S3 Bucket**:
   - Create an S3 bucket to store the stock data and charts.
   - Configure the Lambda function to write data to this bucket.

## Usage

1. **Trigger the Lambda Function**:
   - The Lambda function can be triggered manually or set up on a schedule (e.g., daily).

2. **Stock Analysis**:
   - The function identifies the top 5 stocks in the specified industry.
   - Fetches historical data for these stocks using the stock market API.

3. **Chart Generation**:
   - Generates performance charts for the identified stocks.

4. **AI Recommendations**:
   - The AI model analyzes the stock performance over the past week.
   - Provides buy/sell recommendations based on the analysis.

5. **Data Storage**:
   - The stock data and charts are stored in the S3 bucket for future reference.

## Output

- **Charts**: Visual representation of stock performance.
- **Recommendations**: AI-driven advice on whether to buy or avoid the stocks.
- **S3 Storage**: Stock data and charts stored in the specified S3 bucket.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Data**: Integrate real-time stock data for more accurate analysis.
- **User Interface**: Develop a web or mobile interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Advanced AI Models**: Implement more sophisticated AI models for better prediction accuracy.
